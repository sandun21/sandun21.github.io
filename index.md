<div style="text-align: justify;">
Restaurant Robot which is implemented with a vision based navigation system with the usage of Kinectv2 camera. We have done our project ROS1 Noetic Ninjemys and used fakelidar of kinect to navigate without the usage of a lidar. We used gazebo for simulation purposes and we are still continuing the project with ROS2 integration.

### Biosense-AI Deep Learning Based ECG Signal Classifier and Interpreter
[<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/BioSense-AI) [<i class="fab fa-youtube"></i>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SEWwqLYNFU)
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Biosense-AI is an ECG achieving device which is integrated with Orange pi SBC for computations. It uses our specially designed PCB for filtering and amplification of Ethe signal which is to be fed in to the SBC via analog to digital converter. Also we captures SPO2 and Heart Rate data through integrated sensors which also used to be processed by the SBC. We uses deep learning techniques to capture and uses SHAP values to interpret deformities in ECG waveform.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Developing an algorithm to detect falls of adult individuals and implemented a prototype(PCBs and enclosure) which can be used to detect potential falls with the help of MPU6050 gyroscope and inform required parties via SMS after detecting such incident.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
This is an curriculum related project which mainly focused aboout regulatory aspects of biomedical device design. We developed an prototype for saline flow controller which used to control saline flow providing more customization options for hospitals. We documented the whole device design pathway and prepared documents regarding regulatory aspects.

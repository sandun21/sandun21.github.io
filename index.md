## Projects
### Restaurant Robot
[repo](https://github.com/LUNA-Vision-based-Restaurant-Robot)

Restaurant Robot which is implemented with a vision based navigation system with the usage of Kinectv2 camera. We have done our project ROS1 Noetic Ninjemys and used fakelidar of kinect to navigate without the usage of a lidar. We used gazebo for simulation purposes and we are still continuing the project with ROS2 integration.

### Biosense-AI Deep Learning Based ECG Signal Classifier and Interpreter
[repo](https://github.com/BioSense-AI)

Biosense-AI is an ECG achieving device which is integrated with Orange pi SBC for computations. It uses our specially designed PCB for filtering and amplification of Ethe signal which is to be fed in to the SBC via analog to digital converter. Also we captures SPO2 and Heart Rate data through integrated sensors which also used to be processed by the SBC. We uses deep learning techniques to capture and uses SHAP values to interpret deformities in ECG waveform.

### Fall detection device for eldery people
[repo](https://github.com/Medmindz)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
